          <h3 class="section__header">INTRODUCTION:</h3>
          Hello folks…! As you have read the headline you might have an idea about this blog. If not, you will be knowing a lot about what Aquaponics is? And the symbiotic relationship between the plants and fishes. Aquaponics is combination of aquaculture where the fishes are grown and hydroponics, well this may sound new. The term hydroponics refers to the growth of plants in water by feeding them with adequate amount of minerals without soil. The simultaneous culturing of both the plants and fish is time saving and as well water saving.

        <h3 class="section__header">FISHES FEED PLANTS:</h3>
         The fish mainly excrete Ammonia, which is a toxic substance for fish. As fish requires more water for ammonia excretion. Whereas nitrates is essential for plant growth, which is obtained from ammonia. Reusing this water for the plant's growth, certain residential bacteria (Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter) present at the roots will help in converting the ammonia to nitrites to nitrates.
        IMG3
         As nitrites are still toxic to the fish, they are converted to nitrates. Plants absorb these nitrates for their growth and the clear water is circulated back to the fish. This process sounds beneficial for both the organisms but there is another organism that needs to be taken care off. Yes…! You got it right the micro - organisms. 
        IMG2
        As the microbes play a crucial role in converting the ammonia to nitrates, a proper PH of the environment is essential for their optimum growth and activity. You might have heard that bacteria are active at neutral (7-8) pH, they are mesophile. The suitable ph for Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter is around 8.3-9.3. Too alkaline and too acidic level of pH may affect the growth of bacteria. There are certain factors that affect the ph of the system and interferes with the growth of microbes like hardness of water, the type of fishes that are grown, the climate and feed of plants.

        <h3 class="section__header">CONCLUSION:</h3>
         Here comes the conclusion of this blog about aquaponics. I hope those who are all hanging in there have got an idea about what aquaponics is and how does it work. As I mentioned earlier it’s a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. The plants are chosen to grow in the water fed with adequate minerals without soil because the soil has lost its fertility, lost its moisture, have acidic ph  and become unfit for crop yield in certain areas. I guess this blog is informative for you guys.
        Hope you enjoyed reading!
         Thank you, folks!
